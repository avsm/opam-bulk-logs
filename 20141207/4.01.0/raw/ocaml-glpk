[ocaml-glpk.0.1.6] Downloading http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/ocaml-glpk/ocaml-glpk/0.1.6/ocaml-glpk-0.1.6.tar.gz
[ERROR] Wrong checksum for /home/opam/.opam/packages.dev/ocaml-glpk.0.1.6/ocaml-glpk-0.1.6.tar.gz:
  - daff90d6786f410813dcdd5f56b8a83f [expected result]
  - b2e23b153fad3034ec48336f81eefd33 [actual result]
This is surely due to outdated package descriptions and should be fixed by running `opam update`.
In case an update does not fix that problem, you can use the `--no-checksums` command-line option
to /bypass checking for invalid checksums.
